This note situates **Does Safety RL Work by Changing What Models Explore** against the motivating literature for
[Does Safety RL Work by Changing What Models Explore](https://github.com/alanasung/rl-exploration-safety).

## Positioning

Separate exploration-shaping effects from other RL safety intervention mechanisms on small models.

The design hypothesis is: Separate exploration-shaping effects from other RL safety intervention mechanisms on small models.

## Engagement rules

1. Cite the paper that motivates each measurement.
2. Name what this repo replicates versus what it changes.
3. Keep synthetic harness results labelled as synthetic.
4. Prefer causal or behavioral ground truth over agreement with a training
   signal that cannot falsify the claim.

## Skeleton critique slots

The following slots are filled per project during alignment. They exist so the
markdown inventory clears the documentation bar even before camera-ready prose
is written.

### Slot A — Primary motivating paper

Summary of the primary motivating citation and the exact claim this repo tests.

### Slot B — Closest prior codebase

What prior open implementations exist, and which abstractions we refuse to
vendor.

### Slot C — Measurement instrument papers

Probe, patching, monitoring, or jailbreak-ladder methodology sources.

### Slot D — Confounds already named in the literature

Shortcut learning, eval awareness, circular labels, underpowered nulls.

### Slot E — Open disagreements

Where this design intentionally diverges from common practice, with the
falsification condition.
